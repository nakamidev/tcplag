### `tcplag`

Trying to lag a TCP connection with some magic.

#### Requirements

This project contains TypeScript files.

- If you'd like to run directly instead of compiling you can install `typescript` and `ts-node`.

```sh
# NPM
npm i -g typescript ts-node

# Yarn
yarn global add typescript ts-node
```

- If you'd like to compile it to get a optimized source code, just follow [getting started](#getting-started) section.

#### Getting Started

Firsly, you'll need to install the project dependencies.

```sh
# NPM
npm install

# Yarn
yarn 
```

Then, compile it and run by running.

```sh
# Compiling & Running
yarn build && yarn start
```

> If you have installed `ts-node`, you can run it directly with the source folder as input.
> ```sh
> ts-node src
> ```
